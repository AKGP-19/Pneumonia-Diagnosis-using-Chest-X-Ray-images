## Description of files in the repo

‚û°Ô∏è `app.py` - **Flask** Server

‚û°Ô∏è `Pneumonia_Diagnosis_From_Chest_X_Rays_Final.ipynb` - IPython Notebook containing the code used to train various TensorFlow models.

‚û°Ô∏è `predict_result.py` - Script used to load the saved model and perform inference for an input image.

‚û°Ô∏è `requirements.txt` - Contains the python dependencies & the associated versions.

‚û°Ô∏è `Summary.xlsx` - Excel file containing the metrics (such as train|val|test loss|accuracy, precision, recall, etc) for the 5 models that I have built

#### Error message for grayscale image:
(Some images which you download from the internet, or kaggle dataset are grayscale images and they do not contain 3 color channels. This model specifically required 3 color channels for inference.)
